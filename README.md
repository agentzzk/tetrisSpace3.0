Java based block game created in grade 10 for my Intro. to Java class. Final Project.
##### NOTE: "TETRIS" is copyrighted. The name of the game was only used for educational purposes.

##However
The design of the game is unique and created by me. The implementations of the blocks and the algorithms of the game-play were created by me in Java. Graphics were also designed by me.
#So this means ... Open sourced!
Feel free to use/modify/improve my core Java code of the game objects and design.
- it would be awesome if you could post an issue and then fork the repo for improvements
