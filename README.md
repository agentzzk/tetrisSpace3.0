Java based block game created in grade 10 for my Intro. to Java class. Final Project.
##### NOTE: "TETRIS" is copyrighted. The name of the game was only used for educational purposes.

##However
The design of the game is unique and created by me. The implementations of the blocks, grid, and gameplay algorithms were coded by me in Java.
#So this means ... Open sourced (yay)!
Feel free to use/modify/improve my core Java code of the game objects and design.
- It would be awesome if you could post an issue and then fork the repo for improvements

###Details
- Every block piece is it's own Java object
- A block object is created and put into the grid object.
- Starting class is responsible for setting up the appropriate environment (canvas, screen size, drawing graphics, etc.)
- Game is designed with 2D arrays (grid implementation
